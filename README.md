# DARVIS - The Agentic Discord Bot

DARVIS is an intelligent Discord bot that can understands natural language and can execute complex, multi-step commands using Javascript and Discord.js.

## üöÄ Features

- **Natural Language Processing**: Understands complex Discord-related requests in natural language
- **Dynamic Code Execution**: Executes Discord.js v14 code on-the-fly to perform operations
- **Multi-Step Operations**: Performs complex tasks by breaking them down into steps, enabling sophisticated and unique commands that go beyond traditional bot capabilities
- **Conversation Context**: Maintains conversation history through Discord reply chains
- **GIF Search Integration**: Can search and post GIFs in response to requests
- **Configurable Limits**: Customizable iteration limits and conversation depth
- **Error Handling**: Robust error handling with fallback messaging

## üìã Prerequisites

- Node.js (v16 or higher)
- A Discord Bot Token
- An LLM API Key (OpenAI GPT-4 or compatible API)

## üõ†Ô∏è Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone and Install

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd Darvis
npm install
```

### 2. Environment Configuration

Create a `.env` file in the root directory:

```env
# Discord Bot Token (required)
DISCORD_TOKEN=your_discord_bot_token_here

# LLM API Configuration (required)
LLM_API_KEY=your_llm_api_key_here

# The API key should be for a service that implements the standard chat completions API (like OpenAI, Anthropic, or xAI). 
```

### 3. Discord Bot Setup

1. Go to the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications)
2. Create a new application
3. Navigate to the "Bot" section
4. Create a bot and copy the token
5. Enable the following privileged gateway intents:
   - **Message Content Intent** (required for reading message content)
   - **Server Members Intent** (required for member operations)

### 4. Bot Permissions

When inviting the bot to your server, ensure it has the approprate permissions for the functionality you want.

### 5. Run the Bot

```bash
# Development
npm run dev

# Production
npm start
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration Options

The bot's behavior is controlled through `src/core/config.ts`. Here's what each setting means:

### Core Configuration (`AgentConfig`)

| Setting | Type | Description | Default |
|---------|------|-------------|---------|
| `apiEndpoint` | string | LLM API endpoint URL | OpenAI's GPT API |
| `model` | string | LLM model to use | `gpt-4.1` |
| `systemPrompt` | function | Generates the system prompt for the LLM | Detailed Discord bot instructions |
| `fallbackMessage` | string | Message sent when max iterations reached | Error message |
| `maxIterations` | number | Maximum LLM calls per request | `5` |
| `maxConversationDepth` | number | Max messages to include in context | `10` |

## üîÑ Logic Flow

### 1. Message Processing Pipeline

```
Discord Message ‚Üí Filter (mentions bot?) ‚Üí Build Context ‚Üí LLM Processing ‚Üí Execute Actions ‚Üí Respond
```

### 2. Detailed Flow

1. **Message Reception** (`src/index.ts`)
   - Bot receives a message in Discord
   - Filters out bot messages and non-mentions
   - Shows typing indicator

2. **Context Building** (`src/core/agent.ts#buildConversationHistory`)
   - Traverses reply chain backwards up to `maxConversationDepth`
   - Builds conversation history with user info and roles
   - Formats messages for LLM consumption

3. **LLM Processing Loop** (`src/core/agent.ts#runAgent`)
   - Sends conversation + system prompt to LLM
   - LLM decides whether to:
     - Respond directly with text
     - Execute Discord.js code
     - Search for GIFs
   - Up to `maxIterations` loops allowed

4. **Code Execution** (`src/tools/executor.ts`)
   - Creates sandboxed environment
   - Provides access to `client` and `message` objects
   - Executes generated Discord.js code
   - Returns results back to LLM

5. **Response Delivery**
   - Attempts to reply to original message
   - Falls back to new message if reply fails
   - Handles deleted messages gracefully

### 3. Tool System

The bot uses a tool-based architecture:

- **`execute_discord_js_code`**: Executes Discord.js operations
- **`search_gif`**: Searches and posts GIFs
- Tools are defined with strict schemas for the LLM

### 4. Extensibility

The tool system is designed to be extensible. You can add as many tools as needed to enhance the bot's capabilities. Each tool should:

- Have a clear, focused purpose
- Include comprehensive documentation
- Follow the tool schema format
- Be registered in the agent's tool array

Tools can range from simple utility functions to complex integrations with external services. The LLM will automatically understand how to use new tools based on their descriptions and parameter schemas.

### Adding New Tools

1. Create a new tool file in `src/tools/`
2. Export a tool definition object and execution function
3. Import and add to the tools array in `src/core/agent.ts`

Example tool structure:
```typescript
export const myTool = {
  type: 'function' as const,
  function: {
    name: 'my_tool',
    description: 'Description of what the tool does',
    parameters: {
      type: 'object',
      properties: {
        param1: { type: 'string', description: 'Parameter description' }
      },
      required: ['param1']
    }
  }
};
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏èüî¥ Critical Security Consideration üî¥‚ö†Ô∏è
**Arbitrary Code Execution**
   - The bot executes LLM-generated JavaScript code
   - **Risk**: Malicious code could compromise the bot and server ENTIRELY
   - **Mitigation**: While the current implementation relies on AI alignment and careful system prompting to prevent malicious code generation, this is not a complete security solution. The effectiveness depends heavily on the specific LLM model being used and its alignment. This should not be the only safeguard in place. The execution environment is currently not properly sandboxed. In production, code should only be executed in a fully isolated sandbox environment with additional security measures and restrictions in place.

## üìñ Usage Examples

### Basic Commands
```
@DARVIS ban Henry for spamming
@DARVIS send a funny gif
@DARVIS DM a philosophical quote to everyone with the philosophy role
@DARVIS who has sent the most messages in this channel?
@DARVIS @ a random user in the server
@DARVIS show me the member count of this server
@DARVIS list all users who joined in the last 24h
```
